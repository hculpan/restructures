# Restructures
This is a project to refresh my familiarity with data structures. It is written in C, and the project descriptions/requirements are generated by ChatGPT.

I specifically asked ChatGPT for an outline, with a suggested project with inputs and outputs. I told it not to give me links for lessons; I'll handle learning what I need to, I just want a set of projects to validate my understanding.

Glancing at the list below, the projects are clearly very generic without the specificity I had hoped for. But my plan is to ask ChatGPT to give me a specific project for each section. For sections that list subtopics, I'll ask for a project for each of the subtopics, so some sections will end up having multiple projects to complete.

# Purpose
This is just for fun. I enjoy coding data structures, and one of the things I miss with modern programming languages is the chance to do them. Most languages, including my favorite, Go, have a comprehensive standard library that include the most common data structures. Even when they lack specific data structures, they have other data structures that would often make coding the more advanced data structures, trivial. This is why I chose to do this in C, where such modern conveniences don't exist.

# Course Structure
## Arrays

* Project: Implement a dynamic array that automatically resizes.
* Input: A sequence of numbers.
* Output: A dynamic array capable of resizing based on the number of elements.

## Linked Lists

* Project: Create a music playlist using a doubly linked list.
* Input: A list of songs.
* Output: A playlist allowing addition, deletion, and bidirectional navigation.

## Stacks

* Project: Develop a simple undo-redo functionality in a text editor.
* Input: Text editing commands.
* Output: Ability to undo and redo text changes.

## Queues

* Project: Simulate a print queue system.
* Input: Print jobs with different priorities.
* Output: Order of execution based on priority and arrival.

## Hash Tables

* Project: Implement a simple in-memory key-value store.
* Input: Key-value pairs.
* Output: Efficient retrieval of values based on keys.

## Trees

* Subtopics: Binary Trees, AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees.
* Project: Implement a contact book using a Binary Search Tree.
* Input: Contact details.
* Output: Sorted contact list with efficient search functionality.
